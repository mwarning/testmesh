/*
Compress/Decompress identifier ranges as two segments of differences.

Compression:
1. sort and merge overlapping ranges
2. divide into list of short and long ranges, each prefixed by a varint length field
3. short ranges are stored as a sequence of single diff varint numbers,
   each decoded number represents a single identifier (a range of length 0)
4. long ranges are stored as a sequence of pairs of diff variant numbers,
   two decoded numbers represent a range

If the target space does not fit all data, then ranges are dropped and
merged to make more room available. Ranges that require more bytes to
store the others are dropped first.
